qrohlf.com is the first website I ever built myself, as a way to set myself apart and get a job in high school. The original incarnation was a Wordpress install using a premade theme that I spent weeks learning how to tweak until it was exactly how I wanted. Since then, it's undergone almost half a dozen significant redesigns, changing to match my interests, goals, and professional aspirations.

The first iteration of the site looked like this:

It started as a basic portfolio to showcase my personal robotics and coding experiments. For posterity, I've archived it as a collection of static files at [portfolio-archive.qrohlf.com](http://portfolio-archive.qrohlf.com).
