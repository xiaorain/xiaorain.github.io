# The Ugly Mug

Fairly large. Some outdoor seating options, plus some very well-worn couches + chairs. Good lattes. A bit louder than, say, Either/Or, but still a workable atmosphere.

# Either/Or

Very small (3ish tables). Modern but not cold (unlike Jola!). Friendly staff. Doesn't really feel like a place to hang out in and work - good for meetings and maybe a post-run coffee stop.

# Jola Cafe

Quite large, lots of communal tables.

# SE Grind

Todo

# Ross Island Grocery & Cafe

Nice patio. 1.27 Mbps up/0.42 Mbps down (according to speedtest.net), so that's a little less than ideal for webdev. Could be related to interference from the ~15 other networks in range.
