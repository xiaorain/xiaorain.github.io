# Hello!
I'm Quinn. I like to build interesting things and solve hard problems. I'll be joining New Relic as a software engineer this coming June. For now, I go to school, work on a couple of  [interesting side projects](/projects), and write on this blog. I have a background in full-stack web development and spend a lot of time playing with design ideas and new ways to present content. I believe that simple and thoughtful design can make the world a better place.
